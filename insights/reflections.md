# Reflections

- Growth feels non-linear — it comes in waves when projects align.  
- Keeping Base and Farcaster development in sync gives natural momentum.  
- Balancing technical output with documentation creates trust in the build process.  
- Building the Base Wallet Screener reminded me that clarity beats complexity — one solid API can power a full product.
- Frames feel like bridges: connecting code, data, and people inside one minimal interaction.
- Every deployment closes a loop between learning, making, and showing — and that loop is where momentum lives.
